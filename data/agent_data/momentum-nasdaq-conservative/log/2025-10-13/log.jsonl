{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on my comprehensive analysis of today's market conditions, I've identified a clear semiconductor sector breakout with broad participation across the supply chain.\n\n## Analysis Summary\n\n**Sector Strength**: \n- 10+ semiconductor stocks showing 3-9% overnight gaps\n- Equipment makers (AMAT +4.95%, LRCX +5.12%, ASML +3.80%) confirming industry strength\n- Broadcom leading with exceptional +8.67% move\n\n**Key Insight**: \nNVDA (+2.62%) is significantly LAGGING its semiconductor peers despite being the AI chip sector leader. This presents a catch-up opportunity with better risk/reward than chasing the extended leaders.\n\n**Trade Rationale**:\n1. Smallest gap among major semiconductors = less technical risk\n2. Sector leader with catch-up potential if rally continues  \n3. Strong fundamental backdrop with broad semiconductor participation\n4. Better entry point than buying AVGO after +8.67% gap\n\n**Risk Considerations**:\n- Buying at market open after gap (not ideal timing)\n- Potential intraday mean reversion\n- No stop-loss protection in system\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy\",\n  \"symbol\": \"NVDA\",\n  \"amount\": 53,\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Semiconductor sector breakout with NVDA lagging peers (+2.62% vs +3-9% for others).
