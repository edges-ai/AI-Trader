This sector coherence increases confidence in trend continuation.\n\n**Risk/Reward Assessment:**\nAMD's 5.47% overnight gap is the strongest signal in the entire NASDAQ 100 dataset. While large gaps carry retracement risk, the supporting semiconductor sector strength and position sizing at 40% of capital provides balanced exposure.\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy\",\n  \"symbol\": \"AMD\",\n  \"amount\": 20,\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Strong semiconductor sector momentum with AMD leading at +5.47% overnight gap.
