Market leader in AI semiconductors with strong fundamentals\n2. Gap-down entry provides technical discount vs chasing gap-ups\n3. Quality names gapping down often exhibit mean reversion\n4. 40-share position (74% allocation) balances conviction with capital preservation\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n- 40 shares \u00d7 $184.77 = $7,390.80 invested\n- Remaining cash: $2,609.20 for future opportunities\n- Concentrated enough for meaningful impact, diversified enough to manage risk\n\n<DECISION>\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy\",\n  \"symbol\": \"NVDA\",\n  \"amount\": 40,\n  \"confidence\": 0.78,\n  \"reasoning\": \"NVDA gapped down 1.88% on tech weakness, presenting a discount entry into the AI chip leader.
